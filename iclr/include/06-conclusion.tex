\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we introduced a novel open-source framework for predicting the energy consumption of DL architectures, to allow for a trade-off between performance, energy consumption, and consequently environmental impact. This includes an extensive and modular data-collection process, to facilitate the creation of more DL energy data sets. Furthermore, we propose a first energy prediction baseline, offering insights into the energy behavior of various layer types and show that the MAC count is an important feature for energy prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while it is possible to predict the energy consumption of layers with random configurations, accurately generalizing to real-world architectures remains a significant challenge.
