% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Modern machine learning models have started to consume incredible amounts of energy, thus incurring large carbon footprints \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-02243}. To address this issue, we have created an energy estimation pipeline\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/energy-consumption-dl}}, which allows practitioners to estimate the energy needs of their models in advance, without actually running or training them. We accomplished this, by collecting high-quality energy data and building a first baseline model, capable of predicting the energy consumption of DL models by accumulating their estimated layer-wise energies.
